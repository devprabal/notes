NAME
       sem_init - initialize an unnamed semaphore

SYNOPSIS
       #include &#60;semaphore.h&#62;

       int sem_init(sem_t *sem, int pshared, unsigned int value);

       Link with -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       sem_init()  initializes  the unnamed semaphore at the address pointed to by sem.  The value argument specifies
       the initial value for the semaphore.

       The pshared argument indicates whether this semaphore is to be shared between the threads of a process, or be‐
       tween processes.

       If  pshared  has the value 0, then the semaphore is shared between the threads of a process, and should be lo‐
       cated at some address that is visible to all threads (e.g., a global variable, or a variable allocated dynami‐
       cally on the heap).

       If  pshared  is  nonzero, then the semaphore is shared between processes, and should be located in a region of
       shared memory (see shm_open(3), mmap(2), and shmget(2)).  (Since a child created by fork(2) inherits its  par‐
       ent&#39;s  memory  mappings, it can also access the semaphore.)  Any process that can access the shared memory re‐
       gion can operate on the semaphore using sem_post(3), sem_wait(3), and so on.

       Initializing a semaphore that has already been initialized results in undefined behavior.

RETURN VALUE
       sem_init() returns 0 on success; on error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EINVAL value exceeds SEM_VALUE_MAX.

<p>Excerpts </p>
<ul>
<li>A semaphore is a synchronization primitive used in concurrent programming to control access to shared resources. Think of it like a pool of permits - threads must acquire a permit before accessing the resource and release it when done.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">from threading import Semaphore
# Create a semaphore with 3 permits
printer_sem = Semaphore(3)
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>In this example, the semaphore controls access to printers. Only 3 threads can print simultaneously - if a 4th thread tries to print, it will be blocked until one of the active threads releases its permit.</li>
<li>They maintain a counter that gets decremented on acquire() and incremented on release()</li>
<li>If the counter is zero, acquire() blocks until another thread calls release()</li>
<li>They&#8217;re commonly used for resource pools, producer-consumer scenarios, and limiting concurrency, where you don&#8217;t care which thread accesses the resource, just how many can access it simultaneously.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="binary-mutex-vs-semaphore">Binary mutex vs Semaphore</h2>
<ul>
<li>The three acquire() calls will all succeed because there were initially 3 permits available. The fourth call would block (wait indefinitely) because there are no permits left. The thread would only continue when another thread calls release() to return a permit to the semaphore. This is one of the key differences between semaphores and locks&#47;mutexes - <strong>you can acquire a semaphore multiple times (up to its initial value) without releasing in between</strong>, whereas with a lock you can only acquire it once before needing to release it.</li>
<li>Unlike mutexes which are binary (locked&#47;unlocked), <strong>semaphores can allow multiple threads to access the resource simultaneously.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="re-entrant-mutex-vs-semaphore">Re-entrant mutex vs Semaphore</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>A reentrant mutex (also called a recursive mutex) in C allows the same thread to lock the mutex multiple times</strong> without deadlocking. This is different from a regular mutex, which would deadlock if the same thread tried to lock it twice without an intervening unlock.</li>
<li>Reentrant mutex: The thread <strong>must release the lock the same number of times</strong> it acquired it</li>
<li><strong>In case of reentrant mutex, other threads still cannot acquire the lock while it&#8217;s held</strong></li>
<li>Reentrant mutex: The mutex keeps a count of how many times it&#8217;s been locked</li>
<li><strong>Reentrant mutex: useful for recursive algorithms</strong> or when functions that lock the mutex might call each other</li>
<li>Differences b&#47;w reentrant mutex and semaphore</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>There are two main ways to create a semaphore:
<ul>
<li>Named Semaphores (sys V style) using <code>sem_open()</code></li>
<li>Unnamed Semaphores (process-private) using <code>sem_init()</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The key difference is that <strong>named semaphores persist in the system and can be accessed by different processes using the same name</strong>, while unnamed semaphores exist only in memory and are typically used between threads or related processes that can share memory</li>
<li>What&#8217;s the initial value in sem<em>init? Does it tell us how many permits are allowed? Yes, **the initial value in sem</em>init specifies exactly how many permits are initially available** in the semaphore. It&#8217;s like pre-loading the semaphore with that many &#8220;tokens&#8221; or &#8220;permits&#8221;.</li>
